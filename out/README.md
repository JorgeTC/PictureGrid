OUT DIRECTORY
---
File to add `out` directory to the git tree.

`out` folder is the default location for the output images.
Two images will be generated: a debug image to show the colours used to sort the images and the actual grid with the input images.

The output directory can be modified in the file `src/settings.py`.
